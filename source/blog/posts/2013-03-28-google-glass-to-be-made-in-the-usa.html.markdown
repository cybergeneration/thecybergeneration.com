summary: Project glass will be made in California!
---
Like so many other popular and much-coveted tech gadgets, [Google Glass][] will be made by 
China's Foxconnâ€”but not in China.

The [Financial Times][] is reporting that Google's augmented reality specs will be 
assembled by the Taiwan-based company, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, at a 
facility in Santa Clara, Calif. [Foxconn][] has contracts with many big names in the tech 
world to manufacture and/or assemble laptops, smartphones, and other consumer products in 
facilities around the world, including its massive, city-sized factories in mainland China.

According to the report, the small scale, high cost, and complexity of Glass made it a 
good candidate for the "made in the USA" label.

Presumably, the first few thousand Glass units to be assembled in California will be sent 
out to the 8,000 recently announced [contest winners][] who were given the chance to buy 
Glass early for $1,500.

A number of Googlers were seen wearing Glass at [South By Southwest][]. As far as I'm 
aware, none were [left behind][] in an Austin bar.

Sources have confirmed to CNET that [Glass will be available][] to the general public by 
the end of the year and for under $1,500.
