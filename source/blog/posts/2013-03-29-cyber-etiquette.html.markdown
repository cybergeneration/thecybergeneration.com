Etiquette is about improving relationships, caring for people, making this world a better
place for us and for the generations to come.

In today's world technology is steering etiquette in many different directions. Techie 
people are pushing for such thing as new etiquette rules, saying that in an information 
world, time wasting communication is not just outdated but also rude. On the opposite side 
of the barricade the conservative folks still consider etiquette as a code of social 
behavior and conventional norms.

While technology has given people even more ways to connect, it also has a way of making 
them feel more disconnected than ever. Why pick up the phone when you can hide behind an 
email? Why have a face-to-face conversation when you can shoot off a quick IM? Many seem 
to forget the hand write thank you, get well, congratulations, or even birthday cards.

Now-a-days social media along with all the resources internet offers make all this this 
things as easier as they can be, with a click, in a matter of seconds you can wish happy 
birthday to your best friend you grew up with and blew candles at every anniversary for 
the past 20 years.? Does this take away from the message? Does your friend takes offend on
the e-card you emailed her or the quick line you dropped on Facebook?

We are living in an ultra fast communication era, where some consider that the old-
fashioned hand writing cards cost more in time and efficiently that they are really worth.
When and why we started pricing feelings or personal relationships that?s a question that
I keep asking myself.

People start talking about netiquette?Now what is netiquette?? Netiquette is short for 
network etiquette or Internet etiquette. It is considered to be a set of social 
conventions that facilitate interaction over networks going from mailing list to blogs or
forums. But that is another thing to blog about.
