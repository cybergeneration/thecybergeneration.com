NEW YORK (CNNMoney) - Facebook's stock market debut left founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg 
with a paper fortune currently valued at $13 billion - and a 2012 tax bill of around 
$1.1 billion.

Zuckerberg's whopping tax hit stems from his move last May to increase his stake in 
Facebook. On the day of Facebook's initial public offering, Zuckerberg exercised a stock 
option and purchased 60 million Facebook shares at a "strike price" of 6 cents each.

Even if those shares are never sold, the IRS treats them as ordinary income at the time 
the options are exercised. The rationale is that such options are a form of compensation, 
just like regular wages.

For Zuckerberg, that means reporting income last year of nearly $2.3 billion from his 
stock options alone. Add together the top 2012 federal tax rate of 35% and the top 
California rate of 13.3% - the highest in the nation - and you get a total tax rate 
of 48.3%.

That's before factoring in some deductions and any other income Zuckerberg collected last 
year. Only Uncle Sam and California's tax agency know exactly what's in Zuckerberg's 
return, but three California CPAs that CNNMoney consulted ran the numbers and believe 
Zuckerberg's bill for the year will probably exceed $1 billion.

That's really unusual ... even for billionaires.

"With numbers that large, it's usually capital gains, not ordinary income," said Toby 
Johnston, a partner at tax firm Moss Adams LLP's Silicon Valley office who works with 
wealthy clients. Investors profiting off their gains paid a significantly lower tax rate 
last year than Facebook's founder will. The highest federal capital gains rate in 2012 was 
15%. It goes up to 23.8% (including a Medicare surtax) this year.

The Internal Revenue Service doesn't comment on the returns of individual taxpayers, but 
each year it releases aggregate data on the 400 U.S. tax filers with the largest reported
incomes. The average top earner had income of $202 million and a federal income tax bill 
of $41 million for 2009, the most recent data available.

A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Zuckerberg's taxes.

To cover the giant bill he knew was coming, Zuckerberg dipped into his trove of Facebook 
stock. He sold 30.2 million shares during Facebook's IPO, taking in $1.135 billion. At the 
time, Facebook said in a regulatory filing that Zuckerberg planned to use the "substantial 
majority" of those proceeds to cover the taxes on his stock-option purchase.

And Zuckerberg has another big tax hit looming: He is still sitting on 60 million 
unexercised options that expire in late 2015. At Facebook's current share price, those 
options would generate taxable income of $1.6 billion if he cashed them in. If he cashed 
then in today at current tax rates, that would amount to a $826 million bill.

The U.S. Treasury will benefit from Zuckerberg's taxes. So will California, which is 
getting a windfall as thousands of Facebook employees cash in on stock grants and options. 
California expects to collect roughly $1.5 billion in tax revenue tied to Facebook's IPO,
according to the latest estimate from the state's Legislative Analyst's Office.

So how do you pay a tax bill that's bigger than some nations' entire annual GDP? (We're 
looking at you, Grenada.)

California requires an electronic payment for all tax bills larger than $80,000, but the 
IRS will take a paper check for any amount.

Watching a sum that big vanish from your bank account sounds scary, right? The flip side 
is that at least you can afford it.

"Most people are thrilled, to tell you the truth," said Stan Pollock, a San Francisco area
accountant who specializes in handling tax issues for tech workers. "I have had very few 
clients that get these huge windfalls who have resented paying the tax. They know they 
got lucky."
