summary: 10 commandments to keep you safe online
---

In my latest post about etiquette I mentioned about this thing called netiquette. I 
promise this is not a word that I just invented while writing my blog. Netiquette is been
here for a while and we should only follow it, since some of us spend more time in the 
cyber world than anywhere else. Etiquette is the social behavior that is expected of us by
society. In our cyber world, things'are somehow similar; we follow this code called 
netiquette, cultural norms for status updates, email messages, privacy settings, and 
lists. Like etiquette, netiquette is something that we can never exceed at, there are many
rules and codes to follow but just following the 10 commandments should keep you 
safe online.

1.  **The Golden Rule** Treat others, as you would like to be treated. This rule is an 
    oldie but a goodie and can get you through just about any situation, online or off!
2.  **Forever and for everyone!** You are out there, public, open for anyone. Once you 
    post it online not only stays there but also it can be forwarded, saved and printed by
    people it was never intended for. Posting private and personal information in the 
    wrong location can have serious consequences.
3.  **Use Proper Grammar & Spelling** Spelling isn't always easy and typos and basic 
    spelling mistakes will happen. But if it's distracting from your message, it can be 
    annoying. Don't use too much web jargon; LMAO, c u later u or 4ever are not always 
    appropriate, understood or intended for online communication.
4.  **Avoid offensive comments.** Anything obscene, libelous, offensive or racist, it is 
    not accepted and does not belong in cyber world more that they belong on day-to-day 
    world. Improper, inappropriate or bad language may get a participant kicked out or 
    permanently banned from a forum or group and can create an awful impression to the 
    ones that read it.
5.  **Use emoticons responsibly.** When communicating online, it can be difficult to 
    express emotion. By using emoticons, the writer emotions can be converted to the 
    reader. On the opposite side using multiple explanation points, emoticons, and words 
    in all capital letters can be interpreted as emotional language.
6.  **Be Brief Online.** It is important to keep messages short, especially when writing 
    an email or typing in a chat room. By using common chat abbreviations or 
    [acronyms][], not only will the reader appreciate the brevity of the message, it will
    save the author valuable time typing the message. Remember, keep it short and 
    be brief!
7.  **Obey copyright rules.** Don't steal!
8.  **Think Before Posting.** What is posted online today may come back and haunt you 
    tomorrow. That silly or fun photograph posted on a social networking site, may keep 
    you from getting a job later on. Many colleges and employers are now searching social
    networking sites prior to hiring.
9.  **DON'T SHOUT.** No matter what forum, writing in all capital letters is considered 
    SHOUTING and is considered very rude. A word or two in caps is fine, but shouting is 
    not recommended. Don't type in all CAPS. However, don't write with only small letters,
    as this is perceived as your being lazy, because it makes it more difficult for people
    to read.
10. **Be Aware of Cyberbullying.** Cyberbullying continues to be an increasing problem. 
    Parents should talk honestly and openly to children about the issues of electronic 
    bullying. If targeted by a cyberbully, don't respond.
